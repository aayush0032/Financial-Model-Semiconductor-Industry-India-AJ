📊 Semiconductor Sector DCF Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on valuing three major Indian semiconductor-related companies — HCL Technologies, CG Power, and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) — using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Comparable Company Analysis (Comps).

The goal is to build a comprehensive financial model that projects revenues, costs, and free cash flows, and then derive the intrinsic value of each company. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to test how assumptions like growth rate and discount rate impact valuations.

🏢 Companies Analyzed

HCL Technologies – Large IT services company with increasing exposure to semiconductor design services.

CG Power & Industrial Solutions – Key player in power and industrial systems, diversifying into semiconductor supply chain.

Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) – Government-owned defense electronics company with semiconductor and chip design exposure.

📑 Project Structure

HCL / CG POWER / BEL → Raw financial statements & historical data.

Assumptions → Key model inputs like revenue growth, margins, tax rate, capex, WACC, terminal growth.

Model Sheets (HCL, CG Power, BEL) → Projected financials (Revenue, EBIT, Net Income, FCF).

DCF Valuation → Discounted Cash Flow model for intrinsic value per share.

Comps Valuation → Comparable multiples-based valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA).

Sensitivity Analysis → Impact of different discount rates & terminal growth rates.

Summary → Consolidated valuation results and final insights.

⚙️ Methodologies Used

DCF Valuation

Forecasted Free Cash Flows (FCF) for 5 years.

Calculated Terminal Value using Gordon Growth method.

Discounted all cash flows to present using Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

Comps Valuation

Identified peer companies and industry benchmarks.

Used valuation multiples like P/E and EV/EBITDA.

Compared against sector averages to validate DCF results.

Sensitivity Analysis

Tested different WACC (8% – 12%) and Terminal Growth Rates (2% – 6%).

Evaluated best-case, base-case, and worst-case scenarios.

📈 Key Insights

The semiconductor sector in India is at an inflection point with strong government incentives.

BEL and CG Power show strong intrinsic undervaluation compared to current market prices.

HCL shows moderate upside potential driven by its semiconductor design and IT infrastructure exposure.
